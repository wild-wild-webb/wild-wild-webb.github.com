Webb, Jim Webb, mirrors "dorado", rocket rider
No you don't want nada
Sun on this, hexagonin’ this, NASA running this
Hunting exosolars, look it’s like I told ya
Any planet that’s good for TESS
Glowin’ infrared, where it’s seen by James Webb
Long trek so go check the sky and fly
Watch your trajec’, so you don’t miss L2 wide
Steady your ride, don’t let your RCS react
You don’t want to see the Sun where my ship be at
With Ariane V starting this
Changin’ the game, James Webb ridin’ the blast, so remember my name

Now who ya gonna call?
Not H-S-T
Now who you gonna call?
J Dub to apogee

All you Earthlings co-orbiting the Sun with us
Lemme hear you say, First Light Or Bust, with the

(Chorus)
Wild Wild Webb (when I’m rolling with the)
Wild Wild Webb (when I’m pitching with the)
Wild Wild Webb (when I’m yawing with the)
Wild Wild Webb (STScI, STScI)

We go in space with the Wild Wild Webb (2x)

(2nd verse)
Now now now now you’ll be lookin’ back in time with Webb
Astronomers’ll lose their damn minds over Webb
For the best, cost a pretty dime, nothin’ less
Been through high-G, vac and cryo tests
Sunshield casting shadows, cool the satellite, forever night
All the parts folded in, now start deployin’
Behind the shade, all the alignin’ it did
Fine Guidance Mirror, now whatcha lookin’ at kid?
(WASP-96 b)
What that is? Too much heat, bad for your health
Keepin’ damn cold though, if I could say it myself
Chandra is a rad ‘scope, but I don’t be that
X-rays mad dope, ain’t tryin’ to see that
Don’t try to ground me, the flagship mission
When y’all gonna see that it can’t be done
Understand me hon, I’m the coldest they is
I’m the boldest they is, did I say I’m the coldest they is
So if you flying the wrong delta-V we coming
Don’t be starting nothing
My science team gonna test the best, no sweat
Can’t take heat then hang with the
Wild Wild Webb...

(Repeat chorus)

(3rd verse)
To a space outlaw, trying to yaw, thinking you’re bad
Any yaw on Webb best after clearing the launch pad
Don’t even think about it, six tons, what a mission
A million more clicks from the Sun, done
Perpetual sundown, slewing around
See where nebulae can be found and take their spectra down
The investigators on the Webb
Crushing all the haters of the Webb
You’ve tried the rest, now time to try the
Wild Wild Webb...

(Repeat chorus)
